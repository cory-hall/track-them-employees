  ## Installation
  After copying the code to your machine, you will want to begin by running "npm i" to get all the required libraries installed. You will also want to be sure that you have mysql installed on your machine. To create the required database, login to mysql within your terminal, then type "source db/db/sql;". This will create the data base. After this type "source db/schema.sql" and "source db/seeds.sql". The first instruction creates the necessary tables while the second is optional, but it does give you mock employee's to see the app in use. After you have the database and tables set up, simply run "npm start" in your console to begin.
